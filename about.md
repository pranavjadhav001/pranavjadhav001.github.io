# About me

Hi! I'm Pranav Jadhav, AI practitioner by day, cinephile/footballer/gamer by night.I graduated from DITE college of GGSIPU University of Delhi in 2019.I love to code, draw, train ml models.   
## Career

### Agsmartic Technologies

Agsmartic was first ML internship. Agsmartic was a incubated startup by NASSCOM at that time.As the name goes, It is a Deep Tech Agri startup with blend of AI. I was intern there for 3 months. Since it was my first introduction to ML in production,it was my first encounter with tech such as AWS,Flask for deploying and training ML models. I was given the responsibility of improving model performance and accuracy of disease classification model. Existing architecture used to take input leaf images from users and using a classifier used to predict kind of disease if any. I was asked to train a model to first segment the target leaf out of noisy background and train classifier on these masked images. I approached the problem via Mask RCNN and Unet since it was a semantic segmentation problem.

### SwitchOn

Switchon was my first full time job. Initially I started here as a intern for 2 months and later got converted to full time based on my performance. Switchon is seed funded Deep tech startup whose main goal is to improve plant efficiency using its product. I'm one of the initial members of vision department at the company. Since then I've been involved in vision products such as Surface Inspection, OCR, Absence-presence. I work on the core product of Switchon which is surface inspection product which when deployed inspects parts at the plant and removes outliers/defected parts.
